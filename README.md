# PetShelterDatabaseProject
This is the database project my team and I created for our university course.

all front-end php and html was done by myself,
The database was created with SQL by the entire group.
However, the majority of the database was created by Ariel and myself.

Pet_Shelter_Report.pdf is a full report of the database, the UI, and implementation.
